Excel Analytics 01-
This data contains daily point-of-sales data for Larry's Commissary during the year 2018. 
Each row contains information about the menu item that was sold at the restaurant during the day and two pieces of information about social media activity. 
There are 4,610 observations and 20 columns.
1.Scatterplot-I created a pivot table to aggregate sales data, then selected three menu items to analyze. Using this data, I generated a scatterplot to visualize the relationship         between the sum of quantities sold and the sum of net total revenue for these items. This analysis helps in understanding sales performance and identifying trends among the           selected menu items.
2.Boxplot-I created a pivot table to aggregate sales data and selected four menu items for detailed analysis. Using this data, I generated a box plot to visualize the distribution of     the sum of quantities sold for these items. This analysis helps in understanding sales performance and identifying trends and outliers among the selected menu items



Excel Analytics 02-
It consists of more advanced excel analytics.
Data Sets used for analysis are located in the Excel Analytics 02 folder.

Created a pivot table using two data sets and used leftjoin and used the leftjoin data for further analysis.

1.Correlation Matrix- I obtained a correlation matrix to observe the relationships between various variables and verified these relationships by generating scatterplots. This              comprehensive analysis aids in understanding the interdependencies among the variables and provides visual confirmation of their correlations.
2.Descriptive Statistics - I generated a descriptive statistics table to summarize the key metrics of our dataset. Additionally, I created a histogram of the net total to visually         represent the distribution of this variable. This approach provides a detailed overview of the data and highlights the central tendencies and dispersion of net total values.
3.Regression - I generated a regression table to analyze the relationships between the dependent and independent variables in our dataset. This table provides detailed insights             into the strength, direction, and significance of these relationships, helping to inform data-driven decision-making
